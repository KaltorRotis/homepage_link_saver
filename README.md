# Homepage Link Saver

This is a homepage for desktop browsers. It includes a textbox that converts pasted
URLs to clickable links, saved to local storage. You can save URLs, make notes,
and free up tabs. It works well with the Export Tabs URLs browser extension.

Simply place the source files in a directory of your choice and set your browser's
homepage to the index.html file.
